# House Painting - Certification Project

## Overview
This project is part of the certification requirements. In this creative lab, I built a **House Illustration** using pure CSS. The objective was to design each component of the house and accurately position them using CSS positioning techniques.

## Project Details
- **Project Type**: CSS Art / Layout Exercise
- **Purpose**: Gain hands-on experience with CSS positioning and box layout techniques to visually construct a house.
- **Skills Learned**: `position`, `top`, `left`, `z-index`, layering, CSS shapes, layout logic

## Features
- 🏠 **CSS House Illustration**: A house with a roof, windows, door, and more — built entirely with styled `div` elements.
- 🎯 **Precise Positioning**: Used `position: absolute` and `relative` to place elements exactly where needed.
- 🎨 **Creative Styling**: Each part of the house has its own color, size, and style to reflect real-world appearance.
- 🧱 **Layered Elements**: Utilized `z-index` to manage overlapping parts like chimney and roof.
- ✨ **Optional Animations**: Added hover effects or simple CSS transitions for interactive design (optional).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structural elements for each house component
- **CSS**: Box styling, absolute/relative positioning, shape creation, stacking context, and more
